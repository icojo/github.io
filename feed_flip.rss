        <html><body>helo worldTyrone Garland (born 1992) is an American professional basketball player who last played with the National Basketball League of Canada's Mississauga Power, before the team folded in 2015. Garland initially competed at the collegiate level with the Virginia Tech Hokies, but transferred out during his sophomore season after limited playing time. Before his 2012â€“13 junior season, he joined the La Salle Explorers and instantly assumed a leading role. He lifted them to a second-round win at the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament with a game-winning shot known as the "Southwest Philly Floater". By the end of his college career, his senior basketball class at La Salle had become the most successful in 22 years. Prior to that, Garland starred for John Bartram High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he finished third on the all-time Philadelphia Public League scoring list in 2010, behind only Maureece Rice and Wilt Chamberlain.</body></html>
